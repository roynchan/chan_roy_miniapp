# Roy Chan's Mini App/Website

A Mini Copper Website/Application with fetching function

## Description

A Mini Cooper website using SASS, Vue, AJAX

## Getting Started
I'm fetching the data from a data.json just for a preview, thats why I also included my database and my table SQL along with all my functional PHP files in the "scripts" and "SQL" folder, by changing the main.js-line12 from ' fetch('data.json') ' to 'fetch('./scripts/json.php') ' will start fetching from the database instead of the data.json

### How it runs

A Mini Cooper website using SASS, Vue, AJAX, and the
Fetch API to create a dynamic one-page app/website. Click on one of the Mini models to show more content/data about that model
